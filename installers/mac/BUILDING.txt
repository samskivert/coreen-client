How to make the Mac disk image

1) Run the appropriate ant command for the build you want:

   for a normal installer with just Getdown run:

      ant devclient|client

   for the full installer run:

      ant devclient_full|client_full

2) From a Mac with the necessary software (dev tools, Bang dev
   environment, VPN) installed, do the following:

   % cd /export/bang/projects/installers/mac
   % rsync -avr build.earth.threerings.net:/export/<whichever>/bang/projects/installers/mac/dist .

3) Run 'ant image' ant target. This will create the final, read-only,
   internet-enabled, compressed disk image at dist/bang-install.dmg

4) Verify that the bang-install.dmg is kosher. Then copy it back to
   build.earth.threerings.net.  Accept the accolades of Mac users!
